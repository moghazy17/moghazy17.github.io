Hello! I'm Ahmed Khaled Moghazy, a recent Computer Science graduate from Cairo University with a deep passion for Data Science and Machine Learning. My journey in technology has been driven by a desire to solve complex problems and uncover insights from data.

Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have focused on building robust data pipelines, developing predictive models, and creating intuitive data visualizations. I am proficient in a variety of tools and technologies, including Python, TensorFlow, and Apache Ni-Fi, and I am always eager to learn more.

When I'm not working with data, I enjoy exploring new technologies and contributing to open-source projects. I am a firm believer in the power of teamwork and communication, and I am excited to apply my skills to real-world challenges.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ahmed-khaled-17s) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/moghazy17).
